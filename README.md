Project 2 : Supply chain Dashboard

Introduction
============
Project description
I undertook a supply chain-focused initiative that involved creating a powerful Power BI dashboard using SAP data. This project proved to be a significant success, revolutionizing our approach to data-driven decision-making.

The supply chain dashboard played a crucial role in providing our customers with real-time insights and project status updates, fostering a more informed and efficient discussion environment. Not only did it enhance project visibility, but it also addressed key aspects of inventory management and purchase order status, contributing to the overall optimization of our supply chain operations.

This achievement underscores my commitment to utilizing data-driven approaches for project management and highlights my ability to leverage sophisticated tools such as Power BI to create impactful solutions. It's a testament to my dedication to enhancing organizational efficiency and delivering tangible results in the realm of supply chain management
